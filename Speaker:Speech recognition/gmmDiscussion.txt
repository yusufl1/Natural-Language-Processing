It seems that, holding all else fixed, accuracy decreases when we decrease M, particularly when it is less than 5. Furthermore, accuracy
increases when we increase M. Increasing maxIter from 5 to 15 to 25 shows some fluctuation. Accuracy increases when
we increase maxIter from 5 to 15, but it decreases by the same amount when we increase maxIter from 15 to 25. Also,
when we decrease the number of possible speakers, accuracy increases. As a function of epsilon, our classification
accuracy generally increases as epsilon increases, but it sometimes fluctuates .

We could improve the classification accuracy of the gaussian mixture by using different methods of preprocessing for
the data or by using more components in the gaussian mixture model.

My classifier would never decide that a given test utterance came from none of the trained speakers. This is because
 the test function simply will choose the speaker with the highest log likelihood. If all the speakers had low log
 likelihood, it would simply choose the least low as the speaker, and if all the speakers had equal log likelihoods,
 it would just choose the first element of the list storing the speakers and their log likelihoods, so it's decided
 by python's sorting algorithm since this is used in our test function

We could use deep neural networks like in Kaldi, hidden Markov models, hidden Markov neural nets where we apply
properties of hidden markov models to neural networks, or dynamic time warping which is where we check for similarity
between two time series (instances of speech) using by non-linearly warping one to see if it can be aligned with the
other
