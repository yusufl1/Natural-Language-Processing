It seems add-delta smoothing increases perplexity, proportionally to delta, for both English and French language models.
Therefore, add-delta smoothing makes our models harder to work with.
Furthermore, we can observe a trend that perplexity is initially higher for the English language model, up until
we set detla >= 0.1, and then perplexity becomes higher in the French language model
